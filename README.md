Machine learning involves developing algorithms that can learn from data and make predictions or decisions. A systematic approach is crucial for the successful completion of ML tasks. This repository outlines a comprehensive procedure, covering:

    Problem Definition: Clearly articulate the ML problem, including objectives and constraints.
    Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather relevant data and prepare it for analysis.
    Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Analyze data to uncover patterns and insights.
    Feature Engineering: Create and select features that enhance model performance.
    Model Selection: Choose appropriate algorithms based on the problem and data characteristics.
    Model Training: Train models using the prepared data.
    Model Evaluation: Assess model performance using suitable metrics.
    Hyperparameter Tuning: Optimize model parameters to improve performance.
    Model Deployment: Implement the model in a production environment.
    Monitoring and Maintenance: Continuously monitor and update the model as needed.
